## Description

This is the 13th Module project for the 13th week of the UCB Coding bootcamp, this week we focused on object relational mapping, and back end work using SQL and insomnia. We were given some starter code to complete, where we had to create schema tables, and finish their respective models and routes, so that everything was functional. As well as demonstrating the use of our code through inomnia.
